      <h2><br>Welcome,</h2>
      <p>My name is Angelly and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Southern California (USC), specializing in Artificial Intelligence Applications. My interest in academic research ignited at the age of sixteen when I interned at my university's Biophotonics lab, investigating the relationship between Emerin and Actin protein concentrations in the development of Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy.<br></p>
      <p><br>As an undergraduate at USC, I've been recognized as a Presidential Scholar, Viterbi Fellow, and a Ming Hsieh Institute Undergraduate Research Scholar. These accolades have provided me with exclusive funding, leadership opportunities, and invaluable mentorship.</p>
      <p><br>Now, as I look ahead to my journey as a prospective graduate student, I am looking to integrate my passion for the environment with my interests in machine learning to develop sustainable technology that benefits agricultural communities and promote greater access in communities most burned by the climate crisis.</p>
	  <p><br>Below is a list of featured projects, awards and recognitions in greater detail.</p>

      <h2><br>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>My research interests encompass two primary areas: computational sustainability and human-computer interaction. I have had the privilege to engage in various research experiences, and below are some select examples of my contributions in these fields.<br></p>
      <br>
      <div class="project">
          <h3>Verizon: Identifying Objects and Sorting by Color</h3>
          <p>Over 5 months, I collaborated closely with Verizon engineers and data scientists on a project aimed at training object detection models for product classification. My contributions involved creating training and validation datasets by annotating images of popular phone models and developing a color sorting algorithm by extracting RGB values from these images. These datasets played a crucial role in training the object detection models, which achieved remarkable results in sorting phones by brand and color with a high confidence level of 96% and a precision of 98%. Additionally, the color sorting algorithm was capable of accurately sorting and predicting over 800  distinct colors.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Developing an Emotion Measuring Object (EMO): A Circuit Design Approach for Voice-based Anger Detection</h3>
        <p>During the two-month-long CreAItivity AI Ethics Lab fellowship and competition, I actively engaged in weekly workshops focusing on the current ethical research in AI. As a fellow, I collaborated with a small team to develop an emotion-measuring device that utilized Arduino volume sensors to predict anger levels, earning us 2nd place overall in the competition. Furthermore, I conducted an in-depth analysis on the ethical concerns of artificial intelligence and its potential applications for social good, which I presented and contributed to in writing.</p>

      <h2><br>Featured Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are a select few of my most challenging projects that required a fair bit of research.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Flick Pick: A Collaborative Filtering-Based Movie Recommendation Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>
			Flick Picks is a movie recommendation Chrome extension that utilizes collaborative filtering to create personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and the ratings of a community of users.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Super Mario for VGA</h3>
        <p>
			    In this project, I developed a platformer game inspired by the 8-bit Super Mario for VGA using Verilog and Vivado. The goal was to create a game where the player could move through a map with obstacles and enemies, collect coins, and reach the end. I designed various mechanics, including obstacles with unique behaviors, collision checks, and gravity for realistic jumping and falling.

        <h3>Electric Guitar with Notch-Filter for Signal Attenuation</h3>
        <p> 
          In this project, I successfully built an electric guitar and designed a band-reject filter using a simple op-amp circuit to amplify the guitar pickup's electrical signal and reject specific frequencies. The project consisted of three main phases. In the first phase, I constructed the guitar using a wooden block as the neck and a cigar box as the body, with a Seymour Duncan pickup. In the second phase, I designed the band-reject filter to reject a selected frequency of 196 Hz. I experimented with different resistor and capacitor values using LTSpice and then built the circuit accordingly. In the third phase, I physically built the notch filter and connected it to the guitar pickup, producing sound from the guitar.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Raspberry PI-Based K-Means for Music Genre Classification</h3>
        <p> 
          In this project, I contributed to creating an IoT system that utilized K-means clustering, connecting a Raspberry Pi with RESTFUL APIs to recommend music based on sound sensor data. The process involved using sound sensors to collect data, which was then subjected to K-means clustering to determine the genre of the music. This genre information was used to search the top three tracks belonging to that genre which are displayed on the Raspberry Pi's LCD.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Solar Boat</h3>
        <p> 
          My personal favorite. In this year-long competition, I led a team of 20 students to design a 16-foot solar powered boat accompanied with several technical reports and a public service announcemnt on water conservation. Acheiving perfect scores on every technical report, the first time ever in my high-school's history, placed us as one of the few top scoring teams regionally across all competing schools in California. However, we never got to race our boat due to the pandemic.
