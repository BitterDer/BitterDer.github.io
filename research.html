        <h1>Featured Research</h1>
        <p>My research interests encompass two primary areas: computational sustainability and human-computer interaction. I have had the privilege to engage in various research experiences, and below are some select examples of my contributions in these fields.<br></p>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Using Computer Vision to Predict Plant Growth Cycles and Detect Early Signs of Disease and Abnormality (2023)</h3>
            <p>In progress...</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Verizon: Identifying Objects and Sorting by Color (2022)</h3>
            <p>Over 5 months, I collaborated closely with Verizon engineers and data scientists on a project aimed at training object detection models for product classification. My contributions involved creating training and validation datasets by annotating images of popular phone models and developing a color sorting algorithm by extracting RGB values from these images. These datasets played a crucial role in training the object detection models, which achieved remarkable results in sorting phones by brand and color with a high confidence level of 96% and a precision of 98%. Additionally, the color sorting algorithm was capable of accurately sorting and predicting over 800  distinct colors.</p>

            <h3>The Impact of Emerin and Actin Protein Synthesis Disruption on Muscular Dystrophy Caused by RNA Interference (2018)</h3>
            <p>I began conducting research as young as sixteen years old, with this project being the one to set in motion my interest in pursuing graduate studies. As a research assistant, I applied nuclear extraction and imaging techniques to observe the relationship between Emerin and Actin protein levels in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy development. Analyzing these images revealed no notable protein weight alteration post-RNAi introduction and suggested minimal impact on Actin expression.</p>
