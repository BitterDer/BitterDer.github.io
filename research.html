        <h1>Featured Research</h1>
        <p>My research interests encompass two primary areas: computational sustainability and human-computer interaction. I have had the privilege to engage in various research experiences, and below are some select examples of my contributions in these fields.<br></p>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Computer VisionBased Coffee Disease Detection (2023)</h3>
            <p>Advisor: Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
            <p>I independently developed deep-learning models for the early detection of leaf rust in coffee leaves, achieving 84% accuracy. This included designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), conducting extensive literature reviews to experiment with various CNN architectures, and implementing signal processing techniques like high-pass filtering on each image to distinguish early signs of leaf rust. Developed a comprehensive dataset of over 600 images, akin to the MNIST dataset.</p>

            <h3>Incident Post-Mortem Analysis - Auto-Resolution (2023)</h3>
            <p>I had the privilege to lead the development of an automated data extraction, analysis, and storage pipeline, utilizing large language models, prompt engineering, and natural language processing to identify trends across 300 post-mortem incidents, summarizing months of reports in under 10 minutes and uncovering three new patterns previously unidentified in the manual review process. Collaborated with researchers and data scientists for expert insights.</p>

            <div class="project">
            <h3>Verizon: Identifying Objects and Sorting by Color (2022)</h3>
            <p>Over 5 months, I collaborated closely with Verizon engineers and data scientists on a project aimed at training object detection models for product classification. My contributions involved creating training and validation datasets by annotating images of popular phone models and developing a color sorting algorithm by extracting RGB values from these images. These datasets played a crucial role in training the object detection models, which achieved remarkable results in sorting phones by brand and color with a high confidence level of 96% and a precision of 98%. Additionally, the color sorting algorithm was capable of accurately sorting and predicting over 800  distinct colors.</p>
            <p>In March 2023, this project was awarded finalist title for the National Center of Women in Technology's Collegiate Award. This project was selected amongst 47 projects from undergraduate and graduate women in the nation!</p>
            <p>I also had the opportunity to present my work at the University of Southern California's Ming Hsieh Institute Fall Research Festival, presenting to an audience of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and industry representatives. Below is my poster.</p>

            <h3>Understanding the Role of Machine Learning for Music in Media (2021)</h3>
            <p>Advisor: Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
            <p>I collaborated with a graduate student to explore the quantification of auditory features and musical trends. I presented our research on AI's social applications in media at the Center of Computational Media Intellgence's Spring Hackathon, focusing on the impact of loss functions on model performance, to an audience comprising undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.</p>

            <h3>The Impact of Emerin and Actin Protein Synthesis Disruption on Muscular Dystrophy Caused by RNA Interference (2018)</h3>
            <p>Advisor: Fabien Pinaud</p>
            <p>I began conducting research at sixteen years old, with this project being the one to set in motion my interest in pursuing graduate studies. As a research assistant, I applied nuclear extraction and imaging techniques to observe the relationship between Emerin and Actin protein levels in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy development. Analyzing these images revealed no notable protein weight alteration post-RNAi introduction and suggested minimal impact on Actin expression. I presented my findings at the University of Southern California's Bridge Undergraduate Science Institute Symposium.</p>
